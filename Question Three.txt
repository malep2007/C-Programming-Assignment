(a) The declaration for an array that will hold 50 long type values is given by;
longvalues [50]

(b) Statement that assigns the value 123.456 to the 50th element in the array is:
     values[49]=123.456
     
 (c) For the for loop given by for (x=0; x<100;x++)
 
 (d) The last value of ctr is 11. This is because the loop will add 3 to 2 unti it reaches eight.
 Then it will add 3 to 8 to get 11, then it will check the test condition and stop.
 
 (e) The while statement to count from to 1 to 100 by 3s
 
       #include<stdio.h>
    
       int x=1;
       main(){ 
                 while (x<100) {printf("%d\n",x);
                   x=x+3;
                 }
