/*In the initial code,the if statement had one equal sign but there wrere supposed to be two equal signs to denote x==1.
The if statement works with the word else not the word otherwise as previously stated.
The semi colon on the parentheses of the if statement was not supposed to be there because the if statement is not terminated.*/
