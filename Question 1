QUESTION 1.

//THE CORRECT RUNNING CODE.

#include <stdio.h>
int x= 1; //1ST BUG WAS THE USE OF ":" INSTEAD OF ";"
main()
{
if( x == 1) //2ND BUG WAS THE USE OF THE ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR INSTEAD OF RELATIONAL OPERATOR AND THE USE OF A TERMINATOR OUTSIDE THE IF PARENTHESIS
printf(" x equals 1" );
else       //3RD BUG WAS THE USE OF OTHERWISE INSTEAD OF else
printf(" x does not equal 1");
return 0;
}
