Code by Nsubuga Richard, 17/U/20353/PSA, BELE
Fix the Bug in the following code so that it runs correctly
a program with problems …..
#include<stdio.h>
int x = 1:
main( )
{
if (x=1);
printf(“x equals 1”);
otherwise
printf(“x does not equal 1”);
return 0;
}
*/
//Below is the correct code with comments on where the error was

/*preprocessor that includes functions found
in the header file stdio.h*/
#include<stdio.h>

/*The global variable x was not terminated correctly,
a full colon was used instead of a semi colon*/
int x = 1;

/*The main function has no return value and no arguments
 (this is were the program begins executing)*/
main( )
//opening curly brace for the main function
{
  //The if function was terminated which is a wrong way of using the the if statement
if (x=1)
    //when x=1 the print function will print the argument of the printf function.
printf("x equals 1");
//here otherwise was used insteady of the else
else
    //when the value of x is greater or less than x then the statement on this line will be printed
printf("x does not equal 1");
return 0;//Terminates the main function and returns a zero (0)
}
