long values[50]; 

long values[49] = 123456; 

x is equal to 100 when the statement is complete

The value of ctr is 11 when the statement is complete 

#include <stdio.h> 
 
main(){ 
 
    int count = 1; 
 
    while(count <= 100){         printf("%d ", count);         count += 3; 
    } 
} 

The code under the for loop is always executed once, outside of the for loop, because of the semicolon terminating the for loop.
