NUMBER 3a
An array that holds 50 long type values; 

long grade[50];




NUMBER 3b
Assigning a value to the 50th element in an array of 50 elements:

grade[49] = 123.456



NUMBER 3C 
for(x = 0; x<100; x++)

The values of x in the function above gives a range from 0 - 99 and the final value is 99.




NUMBER 3d 
for(ctr = 2; ctr<10; ctr+=3)

When the above statement is complete:

  The values of ctr are 2, 5 and 8.
  
  
  
NUMBER 3e
for(counter = 1; counter<MAXVALUES; counter++);   
printf("\nCounter = %d", counter);     

The semi-colon on the for loop makes the program to output only one value which is initialized to the counter variable in the for loop.
The output will only show "Counter = 1" instead of iterative values.
