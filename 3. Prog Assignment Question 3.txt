Qn3
Code by Nsubuga Richard, 17/U/20353/PSA, BELE
a) Write a declaration for an array that will hold 50 type long values.
   Solution
   long double SumOfMoney[50];//took it as along double because part b) had a fraction in it, could not use
   only long which is for integers

b) Show a statement that assigns the value of 123.456 to the 50th element in the array from the above question.
   Solution
   long double SumOfMoney[49]=123.456;

c) What is the value of x when the following statement is complete?
   for (x = 0; x<100; x++)
   Solution
   The values of x will be form 0 to 99, i.e after the for loop looping 100 times

d) What is the value of ctr when the following statement is complete?
   for(ctr=2;ctr<10;ctr+=3)
   solution
   The values of ctr will be 2,3 and 8


e) Write a while statement to count from 1 to 100 by 3s
   Solution

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int counter=1;
    while(counter<=100)
    {
        printf("%d\n",counter);
        counter+=3;
    }
    return 0;
}
    /*
f) What is wrong with the following code fragment (MAXVALUES is not the problem!)
   for(counter = 1;counter<MAXVALUES;counter++);
   printf("\nCounter = %d", counter);
   Solution
    The for loop has been terminated by using the semi colon, this is a wrong practice for a for loop
