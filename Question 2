QUESTION 2.


(a).

float do_it(char A, char B, char C)

(b). 

void print_a_number(int A)

(c).
     //WRONG CODE.
#include <stdio.h>
void print_msg( void );//THE FUNCTION NAME IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HAS BEEN DECLARED THAT IS THE FUNCTION NAME DECLARED WAS print_msq AND THE FUNCTION CALLED WAS print_msg
main()
{
    print_msg("This is a message to print");//THE FUNCTION WHICH HAS BEEN CALLED DOES NOT ALLOW PARAMETERS YET IN THIS CODE A PARAMETER HAS BEEN ADDED.
    return 0;
}
void print_msq( void )
    {
    puts("This is a message to print");
    return 0;
    }

                    //THE CORRECT CODE WOULD BE AS SHOWN BELOW.


/*#include <stdio.h>
void print_msq( void );
main(){
    print_msq();
    return 0;
      }

    void print_msq( void )
      {
    puts("This is a message to print");
    return 0;
      }
      */
