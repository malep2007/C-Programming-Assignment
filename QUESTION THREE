/* SOLUTION TO QUESTION 3 */
long array[50]; // DECLARATION FOR AN ARRAY THAT WILL HOLD 50 TYPE LONG VALUES
long array[49]=123456;// STATEMENT THAT ASSIGNS 123.456 AS 50TH ELEMENT IN THE ABOVE ARRAY
for(x=0;x<100;x++)// THE VALUES OF X WILL BE 0 TO 99 WHEN THE "FOR" STATEMENT IS COMPLETE
for(ctr=2;ctr<10;ctr+=3)// THE VALUE OF ctr WILL BE 8 WHEN THE STATEMENT IS COMPLETED



/* WHILE STATEMENT THAT COUNTS FROM 1 TO 100 IN STEPS OF 3*/
# include <stdio.h>
 main(void)
 {
  int count=1;
while(count<=100){
	printf("%d",counter);
	count+=3;
}
}

// PROBLEM WITH THE CODE
for (counter=1;counter<MAXVALUES;counter++);
printf("\nCounter=%d", counter); // THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE FOR LOOP; THE FOR LOOP IS NEVER TERMINATED WITH SEMICOLON
