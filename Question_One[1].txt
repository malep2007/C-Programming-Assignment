Question One
#include<stdio.h>
int x=1; /*variable is declared before the main() function */
main()
{
      if(x==1)/*the if statement is not meant to be terminated and use of assignment operator instead of relational operator*/
  printf("x equals 1");
  else /*the if-else syntax was wrong, it cannot be if-otherwise*/
  {
  printf("x does not equal 1");
  }
