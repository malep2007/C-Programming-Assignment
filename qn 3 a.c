//A declaration for an array that will hold 50 type long values
long values[50];

//a statement that assigns the value 123,456 to the 50th element in the array from the above equation
long values[49] = 123456;

//x is equal to 100 when the statement is complete

//The value of ctr is 11 when the statement is complete

// What is wrong with the following code fragment (MAXVALUES is not the problem !)

//The code under the for loop is always executed once, outside of the for loop, because of the semicolon terminating the for loop.
