/* The array is of type long double since it is to hold a large floating value****
**********************************************************************************
*/


int main () 
	{
		/* Declaring an array of type long double that holds 50 elements*****
		*********************************************************************/
		long double a[50]; 
		a[49]=123.456 ;   // Assigns 123.456 to the 50th element of the array

   int main () 
	{
		/* Declaring a variable y of integer type and assigning it initial value 1 
		*********************************************************************/
		int y = 1;
		while ( y <= 100)    // The test condition the loop runs as long as y is less of equal to 100
		{
			printf("\n %d", y);  // as long  as the loop runs the value of y is printed
			y+ = 3;      // y incremented by 3
		} 
		return 0;
	}
	
	
Question three (e)
	
    What is wrong with the following code fragment (MAXVALUES is not the problem !)
