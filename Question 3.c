
long values[50]

long values[49] = 123.456

final value of x is 100

final value of ctr is 11






#include <stdio.h>

main(){
 /*let count variable be x*/
int x = 1;
while(x <= 100){
    printf("%d ", x);
    x += 3;
    }
}



the problem is that the for loop has no parenthesis to indicate a statement and it is terminated at a wrong location
