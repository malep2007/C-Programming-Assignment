(a) float do-it(char1, char2, char3)
(b) void print-a-number(int)
(c) The program had the following errors. 
1. The two functions print_msg and print_msq that are in the program are diferrent so the compiler
    will fail to distinguish between which one to use.
 2.The function known as print_msg() should have empty parentheses. This means it shouldnt have an argument 
    in because it was declared void.
