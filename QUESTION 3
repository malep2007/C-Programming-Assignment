//Answers of question 3:
//i)	long values[50];

//ii)	long values[49] = 123.456;

//iii)	x is equal to 99  when the statement is complete

//iv)	The value of ctr is 8  when the statement is complete




//v)
#include <stdio.h>
main(){
int x = 1;
while(x <= 100){
//vi)
  printf("The value of x : %d\n ", x);
  x += 3;
}
}
//Comment: The X will be counted from 1 to 100 by adding 3

//vii)	We donâ€™t have to put the semicolon to terminate the for loop and the statements for a for loop should be enclosed.
