 //the problems in the program of question 2 part 3 are below
 >the function header was terminated and yet it
  shouldn't be terminated

 >the print_msg function shouldn't take any arguments
  but the main function will call it with a string argument

 >Another problem is that the function name in the function
  declaration is print_msq() which is wrong because it sould
  instead be print_msg()
