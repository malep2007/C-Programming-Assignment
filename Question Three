Question Three

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

/* The array is of type long double since it is to hold a large floating value****
**********************************************************************************
*/


int main () 
	{
		/* Declaring an array of type long double that holds 50 elements*****
		*********************************************************************/
		long double a[50]; 
		a[49]=123.456 ;   // Assigns 123.456 to the 50th element of the array
		return 0;
	}
	
	
	
	What is the values of x when the following statement in complete ?
       for (x = 0; x < 100; x++),
       
       ANSWER: x will be equal to 100.
       
       What is the value of ctr when the following statement is compelte ?
       for(ctr = 2; ctr < 10; ctr += 3),
       
       ANSWER: ctr will be equal to 11.
       
       
       
       /* The while statement*****************************************************/

  #include <stdio.h  // The while statement.
  #include <stdlib.h>


int main () 
	{
		/* Declaring a variable y of integer type and assigning it initial value 1 
		*********************************************************************/
		int y = 1;
		while ( y <= 100)    // The test condition the loop runs as long as y is less of equal to 100
		{
			printf("\n %d", y);  // as long  as the loop runs the value of y is printed
			y+ = 3;      // y incremented by 3
		} 
		return 0;
	}
	
	
	
	
    What is wrong with the following code fragment (MAXVALUES is not the problem !)
    for (counter = 1; counter < MAXVALUES; counter++ );     
    printf("\nCounter = %d", counter);
   
   ANSWER: The semicolon after the for statement should not have been there.
